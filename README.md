Web developper and Computer Vision diplomee, graduate of Pierre and Marie Curie University, in Paris, today I study Information Design at the Design Academy Eindhoven, in the Netherlands.

Committed to re-think the current authority of Internet; I work towards self and community-made tools for everyone and involving everyone using free, open and decentralized means of production with care and ecological sustainability. I am looking to create forms by hacking and revealing the complexity hidden both in the support and the context.
